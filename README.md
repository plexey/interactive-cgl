This project is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 

It is built with the [Solid JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) framework and styled with [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/).

Features and functionality:

- Play / pause simulation - freeze and resume the simulation at any time.
- Step through simulation - step through the simulation frame by frame.
- Free draw - draw arbitrary patterns in the grid, and see them evolve and change when running the simulation.
- Pattern place - select from a set of included patterns, including still lifes, oscillators and spaceships. 
- Randomize - create a random distribution of living and dead grid cells
- Undo - made a mistake? Hit the undo button!
- Clear - wipe the grid clean and start again
